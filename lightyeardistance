# Speed of light in meters per second
speed_of_light = 3 * 10**8  # 3 * 10^8 meters/second

# Number of seconds in a minute, minutes in an hour, hours in a day, and days in a year
seconds_per_minute = 60
minutes_per_hour = 60
hours_per_day = 24
days_per_year = 365

# Calculate the number of seconds in a year
seconds_per_year = seconds_per_minute * minutes_per_hour * hours_per_day * days_per_year

# Calculate the distance light travels in one year (light-year)
light_year = speed_of_light * seconds_per_year
